# Real-time EEG Monitoring with Python

This project aims to create an EEG GUI for real-time plotting and to be the BCI approach for sending the predicted SSVEP command to Unity.
This GUI can stream EEG data via LSL from an EEG device.

Please set up follow instructions below:

1. Download VScode on your PC [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Download Python V.3.11 [Python V3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)
3. Download this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/pipogood/BCI-Class-Material.git
```
4. (Optional) To create local environments in VS Code using virtual environments (venv), you can follow these steps: open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), search for the Python: Create Environment command, and select it.
[venv setup tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)
5. Direct to your download file path and install required library:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
